<p align="justify">
I am … … … and I am 16 years old. I am an SSC examinee this year. On regular days I spent most of my time in my reading room. My mother is a teacher and she gives me the proper guideline for my studies. I like to write stories, poetry, and short documentary in my leisure. My father sent those writing for newspaper publication.  My teachers, family members, and friends always appreciate my creative writing. 

I am the eldest son of my extended family. I love the company of my family member and especially my grandparents. My grandfather is a retired doctor and he always helps poor villagers. He is my best friend and I follow him as my idle. My aim is to be a doctor so that I can help poor and helpless people. I got inspiration from learning new things and reading the book from my grandmother. I have a pet cat and I named it Pussy.

My hobby is gardening and listening to music. I play with my friends after school and cricket is my favorite game. I always take part in the annual sports competition and I am a member of the debate competition at our school. I always try to follow the instructions of my father. He is an engineer and he instructs me to be honest and punctual. I try to fulfill my responsibilities wholeheartedly. I prepared my lesson with full dedication and my teacher encourage my effort.
